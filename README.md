Looney Tune Detector
====================
This project utilized OpenCV in an Android setting to recognize trained images of Looney Tune's characters. The application used the Computer Vision feature detection technique to determine if a known Looney Tune's character was in the field of vision of the mobile device's camera. 

This project served as a preliminary educational tool for the CityScape application as a part of my master's program.
